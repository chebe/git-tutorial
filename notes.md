# Notes

- Diff created in 1970, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff

- SCCS, 1972

- RCS, 1982, better format than SCCS

- Patch built on diff, 1985 (Larry Wall of Perl Fame)

- CVS, 1986 (on top of RCS)

- SVN, 2000, modern successor to CVS

- CVS and SVN had problems with larger teams + you couldn't work on the train

- Proliferation of "Distributed Source Control Tools", GNU arch (then baz and then bazaar)

- Linux used BitKeeper (which derived from Sun TeamWare, built on SCCS + NFS) until there was a license fall out

- Linus wrote Git (coincidentally another kernel developer wrote Mercurial)
